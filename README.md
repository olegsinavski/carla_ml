# Run CARLA simulator in a docker container with additional features:
 - forwarding VNC display, so that you don't have to use a monitor
 - install `torch` and other common deep learning packages into the same container
 - run jupyter from the same container to explore CARLA

# Usage
Run `./sandbox.sh`. This should set up everything and print how to ssh into the container, open VNC and jupyter.
